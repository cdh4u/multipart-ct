# Introduction

This memo defines application/multipart-core, an application-independent
media-type that can be used to combine representations of several different media types
into a single CoAP {{-coap}} message-body with minimal framing
overhead, each along with a CoAP Content-Format identifier.

This simple and efficient binary framing mechanism can be employed to
create application specific request and response bodies which build on
multiple already existing media types.

Applications using the application/multipart-core Content-Format define the
internal structure of the application/multipart-core representation.

For example, one way to structure the sub-types specific to an application/multipart-core
container is to always include them at the same fixed position.
This specification allows to indicate that an optional part is not
present by substituting a null value for the representation of the part.

Optionally, an application might use the general format defined here,
but also register a new media type and an associated Content-Format
identifier --- typically one in the range 10000-64999 --- instead of
using application/multipart-core.

# Multipart Content-Format Encoding

A representation of media-type application/multipart-core contains a collection of
zero or more representations, each along with their respective content
format.

The collection is encoded as a CBOR {{-cbor}} array with an even
number of elements.
The second, fourth, sixth, etc. element is a byte string containing
a representation, or the value `null` if an optional part is indicated
as not given.
The first, third, fifth, etc. element is an unsigned integer
specifying the content format ID of the representation following it.
(Future extensions might want to include additional alternative ways of
specifying the media type of a representation in such a position.)

For example, a collection containing two representations, one with
content format ID 42 and one with content format ID 0, looks like this
in CBOR diagnostic notation:

> \[42, h'0123456789abcdef', 0, h'3031323334']

For illustration, the structure of an application/multipart-core representation can
be described by the CDDL {{-cddl}} specification in {{mct-cddl}}:

~~~CDDL
multipart-core = [* multipart-part]
multipart-part = (type: uint .size 2 / text, part: bytes / null)
~~~
{:#mct-cddl title="CDDL for application/multipart-core"}

## Registration of a Content-Format identifier for application/multipart-core

IANA is requested to register the following Content-Format to the
"CoAP Content-Formats" subregistry, within the "Constrained RESTful
Environments (CoRE) Parameters" registry, from the IETF Review space
(specifically, 256..999):

   | Media Type                 | Encoding | ID   | Reference |
   | application/multipart-core | ---      | TBD1 | RFCthis   |

# Security Considerations {#Security}

The security considerations of {{-cbor}} apply.  In particular,
resource exhaustion attacks may employ large values for the byte string
size fields, or deeply nested structures of recursively embedded
application/multipart-core representations.
